# Network Traffic Analysis on Kali Linux

This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze SSH network traffic to detect suspicious activity using Kali Linux.

## Tools used
- **Kali Linux** â€“ Penetration testing environment
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** â€“ Basic firewall
- **fail2ban** â€“ Prevents brute-force login attacks
- **SSH** â€“ Secure remote access
- **tcpdump / Wireshark** â€“ Network traffic capture and analysis

## Objective
Capture live network traffic, simulate suspicious SSH activity, and analyze it to identify credentials or attack patterns.

## Steps covered
1. Installing required tools
2. Configuring SSH, UFW, and fail2ban
3. Capturing traffic using tcpdump and Wireshark
4. Analyzing SSH login attempts
5. Documenting the before/after state

## Repository Structure
- `commands.txt` â€“ Commands used during setup
- `configs/` â€“ Configuration files
- `screenshots/` â€“ Visual proof of activities
- `captures/` â€“ Packet capture files
- `notes/` â€“ Summary of findings
